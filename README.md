For Question Answering (QA) and Document Retrieval: create_retrieval_chain() â†’ Flexible and customizable. 

When to use: If you need a custom pipeline for RAG with specific pre-processing, post-processing, or multi-step logic. Example use case: Building a sophisticated chatbot with contextual memory and external data retrieval. 

RetrievalQA â†’ Easiest to set up for question-answering. When to use: If you want a quick and simple RAG implementation for straightforward QA over documents. Example use case: FAQ bots or knowledge base search tools. VectorDBQA â†’ Best for working with FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc. When to use: If youâ€™re storing documents as embeddings in a vector store and need semantic search. Example use case: Semantic search-based QA systems with large-scale datasets. 

ConversationalRetrievalChain â†’ Keeps conversation context while retrieving documents. When to use: If you want multi-turn conversations where the chatbot remembers context across questions. Example use case: Customer support bots or personal AI assistants. 



For Summarization: 

load_summarize_chain() â†’ Full-featured summarization with different strategies. When to use: If you need a flexible summarization pipeline supporting map-reduce, refine, or stuffing methods. Example use case: Summarizing long articles, research papers, or reports. 

StuffDocumentsChain â†’ Fast and simple for short text. When to use: When the text is small enough to fit in a single LLM call. Example use case: Summarizing emails, short blog posts, or news articles. MapReduceDocumentsChain â†’ Best for large-scale summarization. When to use: If you have long documents and need to summarize in chunks efficiently. Example use case: Summarizing books, long PDFs, or datasets. 

RefineDocumentsChain â†’ Great for iterative, detailed summarization. When to use: If the quality of the final summary matters more than speed, and you want the summary to evolve over multiple passes. Example use case: Technical reports or detailed analyses.  For Advanced Pipelines: LLMChain â†’ Basic chain for a single LLM call. When to use: If youâ€™re just sending a prompt and getting a response. Example use case: One-off completions, like text generation or simple Q&A. 

SequentialChain â†’ Executes multiple chains in sequence. When to use: If you need to run multiple steps where each step depends on the previous output. Example use case: Multi-step workflows, like data extraction + summarization. 

SimpleSequentialChain â†’ A simpler version of SequentialChain without variable passing between steps. When to use: When you just want one output fed into the next without custom intermediate logic. Example use case: Basic text transformations or data pipelines. RouterChain â†’ Routes input to different chains based on conditions. When to use: If you want dynamic behavior â€” like choosing different models or workflows depending on the input.

Example use case: Multi-language support or context-sensitive answers. MultiPromptChain â†’ Chooses a different prompt based on input type. When to use: If you need different styles of LLM interaction depending on the questionâ€™s category. Example use case: A bot handling multiple domains like tech support, HR queries, and sales.  Want me to set up one of these chains in a project, show code examples, or help with any specific use case? Let me know! ðŸš€
